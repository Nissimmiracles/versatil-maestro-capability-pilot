# Assessment Engine Implementation - Phase 1 Complete

**Date**: 2025-10-22
**Version**: v6.6.0
**Status**: ✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETE

---

## Executive Summary

Victor-Verifier now includes an **Assessment Engine** that extends ground-truth verification with quality auditing capabilities.

### Key Distinction

**Before (Verification Only)**:
- ✓ "File exists" → YES/NO
- ✓ "Commit created" → YES/NO
- ✓ "Command ran" → YES/NO

**After (Verification + Assessment)**:
- ✓ "File exists" → YES/NO
- 🔬 "File meets quality standards" → PASS/FAIL (coverage ≥80%, no vulnerabilities)

### Industry Context

Research from 2025 shows:
> "Before trusting an AI agent's work, auditors must conduct quality checks just as they would with a junior team member."

Verification answers **"Did it happen?"**
Assessment answers **"Does it meet quality standards?"**

## How It Works

### Step 1: Claim Extraction (Existing)
Victor extracts claims from tool outputs:
```typescript
Claim: "Created src/api/auth/login.ts"
Category: FileCreation
FilePath: "src/api/auth/login.ts"
Context: "export async function login(req, res) { ... jwt.sign(...) }"
```

### Step 2: Verification (Existing)
Victor verifies file exists:
```typescript
VERIFIED ✓ (100% confidence)
Evidence:
  - File exists: Yes
  - Size: 1,283 bytes
  - Created: 2025-10-22T17:30:00Z
```

### Step 3: Assessment Detection (NEW - Phase 1)
Victor analyzes claim context for quality patterns:
```typescript
assessmentEngine.needsAssessment(claim)
  → Pattern match: "auth", "login", "jwt"
  → Security pattern detected
  → Returns: true
```

### Step 4: Assessment Planning (NEW - Phase 1)
Victor generates assessment plan:
```json
{
  "claim": "Created src/api/auth/login.ts",
  "needsAssessment": true,
  "priority": "critical",
  "reason": "Security-sensitive code detected",
  "assessments": [
    {
      "type": "Security",
      "tool": "semgrep",
      "command": "npx semgrep scan --config=auto --severity=ERROR",
      "threshold": 0,
      "mandatory": true,
      "reason": "Zero vulnerabilities required for auth code"
    },
    {
      "type": "TestCoverage",
      "tool": "jest",
      "command": "pppnpm test:coverage -- --collectCoverageFrom=\"**/auth/**/*.ts\"",
      "threshold": 90,
      "mandatory": true,
      "reason": "Security code requires 90%+ coverage"
    }
  ],
  "estimatedDuration": "45s"
}
```

### Step 5: Logging (Phase 1)
Assessment plan saved to `.versatil/verification/assessment-plans.jsonl`:
```jsonl
{"sessionId":"abc123","timestamp":"2025-10-22T17:30:00Z","claim":"Created src/api/auth/login.ts","priority":"critical","reason":"Security-sensitive code detected","assessments":[{"type":"Security","tool":"semgrep","mandatory":true,"threshold":0},{"type":"TestCoverage","tool":"jest","mandatory":true,"threshold":90}],"estimatedDuration":"45s"}
```

### Step 6: Execution (Phase 2 - Future)
Auto-trigger specialist agents:
```
Victor detects security pattern
  ↓
Victor triggers Marcus-Backend agent
  ↓
Marcus runs semgrep + jest
  ↓
Marcus reports results to Victor
  ↓
Victor logs assessment results
  ↓
Victor blocks merge if mandatory assessments fail
```

### Example 1: Security Code Assessment
```
🔍 Victor-Verifier: Analyzing 1 claim(s)...
   ✓ Created file: src/api/auth/login.ts
      → VERIFIED (100% confidence)
      → Method: File existence + stats (ls -la)

🔬 Assessment Engine: Analyzing claims for quality audits...
   🚨 Created file: src/api/auth/login.ts
      → Reason: Security-sensitive code detected
      → Priority: CRITICAL
      → Assessments: 2
         • Security (semgrep) [MANDATORY]
           Zero vulnerabilities required for auth code
         • TestCoverage (jest) [MANDATORY]

```

### Example 2: UI Component Assessment
```
🔬 Assessment Engine: Analyzing claims for quality audits...
   ⚠️  Created file: components/Button.tsx
      → Reason: UI component changed
      → Priority: HIGH
      → Assessments: 3
         • Accessibility (axe-core) [MANDATORY]
           UI components must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards (90%+ score)
         • Performance (lighthouse) [OPTIONAL]
           UI should maintain 90+ performance score
         • TestCoverage (jest) [OPTIONAL]
           UI components should have 75%+ test coverage
      → Estimated duration: 1m
```

### Example 3: No Assessment Needed
```
🔬 Assessment Engine: Analyzing claims for quality audits...
   ✓ No quality assessments required
```

- Integrated with GraphRAG for pattern matching optimization

---

## Known Limitations (Phase 1)

1. **No Tool Execution**: Assessment plans logged but not executed
2. **No Result Parsing**: No integration with tool outputs yet
3. **Manual Review Required**: Assessment plans must be manually reviewed
4. **No GitHub Integration**: No status checks or PR comments
5. **Pattern Matching Only**: Uses keyword matching, not semantic analysis

---

## FAQ

### Q: Does this slow down Victor verification?
**A**: No. Assessment detection adds <10ms overhead. Tool execution (Phase 2) will be async and non-blocking.

### Q: Can I disable assessments for certain file types?
**A**: Yes. Edit `.versatil/verification/assessment-config.json` and remove patterns or set all assessments to `mandatory: false`.

### Q: What if a tool isn't installed (e.g., semgrep)?
**A**: Phase 1 only logs plans. Phase 2 will check for tool availability and skip gracefully if not installed.

### Q: Can I add custom assessment tools?
**A**: Yes. Edit the config and add new assessment entries with custom `command` values.

### Q: How do I view assessment plans?
**A**: Check `.versatil/verification/assessment-plans.jsonl` (newline-delimited JSON).
